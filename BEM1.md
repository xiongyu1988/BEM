### 1. Key Points
Understanding Boundary Element Method (BEM) always start with a simple 1D problem which could be 1D Laplace equation. This is a great application for both mathematical explanation and visualization. 

### Green's Identities and reciprocal relation
These identities are fundamental to the Boundary Element Method (BEM). They allow us to convert domain integrals to boundary integrals. They're crucial for proving uniqueness of solutions. 

In the context of Laplace Equation,
1. Green's first indentity represent energy conservation.
2. The boundary terms represent flux through the boundaries.
3. The integral term represents the internal energy.
